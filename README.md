# MLMUS-Subject-Specific-Effect-and-Confounding
This project was initiated under the supervision of Dr. Joon Ho Lee, Assistant Professor, Education Research Program, The University of Alabama. 
The primary objective of this project was to create an R companion for Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling Using Stata (MLMUS) book by Sophia Rabe-Hesketh, and Anders Skrondal, to facilitate R-based analysis of multilevel and longitudinal modeling.
The code developed in this section is aimed on chapter 5: Subject Specific Effects, Endogenity and Unobserved Confounding of MLMUS book. In this project, we used the same data set, but all the codes are converted into R-codes.   
This project will be enormously useful for students and professionals who plans to engage in multilevel modeling in R. All the theoretical explanations are provided in MLMUS.
